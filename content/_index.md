I am a Slovenian engineering student pursuing graduate studies at the [Technical University of Munich, Department of Brewing and Beverage Technology](http://lbgt.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=5&L=1) in Freising. My research focuses on the use of lattice Boltzmann methods for simulation of physical phenomena related to food and beverage process engineering such as drying and multiphase flow.

## Research interests:

* Lattice Boltzmann methods and their application to fluid dynamics, multiphase flow, mass transport, heat transfer and chemical reactions.
* Off-lattice Boltzmann methods
* Meshless methods in fluid and solid mechanics.
* Computational methods for the solution of partial differential equations.
* Mathematical modelling in life sciences.

## Background

I received my master's degree in chemical engineering at the Faculty of Chemisty and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana in the [microprocess engineering group](http://chemeng.fkkt.uni-lj.si/?page_id=21). My thesis titled "The Description of Chemical Reactions with the Lattice Boltzmann Method" was supervised by Prof. Dr. Igor Plazl and [Prof. Dr. Tomaz Urbic](http://www.urbic.com/). In the final year of my master's I also worked shortly as a student researcher at the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Laboratory](http://www-e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/) at the Jozef Stefan Institute as a developer of the [medusa](http://www-e6.ijs.si/medusa/wiki/index.php/Medusa) meshless method library.
