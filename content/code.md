In my free time I like to work on scientific coding projects in Fortran.


## Fortran interfaces
* [nlopt](https://github.com/ivan-pi/nlopt)
* [METIS](https://github.com/ivan-pi/fmetis)
* [FLANN](https://github.com/ivan-pi/flann): 
Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (original library [here](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/flann))


## Legacy code
* [TOMS 494](https://github.com/ivan-pi/TOMS-494): PDEONE - Solutions of systems of partial differential equations in one dimension
* [TOMS 675](https://github.com/ivan-pi/TOMS-Algorithm-675): Fortran subroutines for computing the square root covariance filter and square root information filter in dense and hessenberg forms
