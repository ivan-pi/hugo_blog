At university I’m currently working on a project report on pasta drying, analyzing CT datasets of dry pasta, and writing a scientific publication on the same topic. Sounds *dry*, but it’s not, really. ;)

Outside of work I’m currently:
* Creating my personal website.
* Adding finishing touches to the Modern Fortran NLopt wrapper. I posted about it recently on the Intel Fortran Forum.
* Tinkering with PDEONE.
